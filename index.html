            <p class="text-center">We are definitely going to miss you JJ! You have been an awesome co-worker and a great friend, and there will be a JJ-sized hole in my life once you leave. I wish you the best man, and hope that our paths cross again! Good luck!</p>

            <p class="text-center">So sad to see you go, man - but super excited for you as well. I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed getting to work with you over the past 3 years. I know y'all are going to love ATX, and I'll definitely hit you up when I'm in town. Also, we still need to schedule that movie night ASAP before you leave! Cheers brotha!</p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ has always been incredibly welcoming and cool since the very jump. He was one of the first people I met the first time I walked into Primitive and ever since then, he's been nothing shy of a class-act. Funny, wise, "with it" when it comes to food, always down to talk music, and always eager to show a genuine interest in the stuff that meant something to you. He might be leaving Primitive, but he's moving to my neck of the woods, which means I still get to grab a beer with him or try new food when he's down. Thanks JJ. Much love.</p>

            <p class="text-center">I wish I would have gotten to work with and learn from JJ more than I did. He's incredibly talented, thoughtful, and hilarious. The opportunities I did have to interact with him were always insightful and more importantly joyful. It's evident how deeply he cares for his craft and his coworkers. He'll be terribly missed :broken_heart: </p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ! A reliable teammate, someone who pushes me to think deeper about strategy, and always makes me feel like you actually care about what's going on in my life. You will be greatly missed around here. And to finally answer your question....Yes, my dad is indeed a Dojo 😜</p>

            <p class="text-center">I appreciate that JJ is so incredibly thoughtful and aware of others’ needs. He loves and gives of himself sacrificially. Favorite memory: table one good times and him playing my favorite music on my birthday. Also, his Costco video for the October 2020 virtual all team.</p>

            <p class="text-center">I will miss you Papa John. I'm glad you are chasing what you want to do though and hope you have a great time doing it. One of my favorite memories of JJ is when he posted a picture of his baby and it looked exactly like JJ. I think it's cool when people become dads.</p>

            <p class="text-center">The thing that I appreciate about JJ and will miss the most is his sincerity. JJ is someone that says what he means and does what he says. He's a loyal/selfless friend and those things go beyond the immense amount of skill set he has.
                <br><br>
                My favorite memories involve a fire and glass of whiskey - Or, running into him and his family at the park. </p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ is just an overall amazing human being. He's original, he's himself, and when cancer tried to break him down - he stood tall, unfazed, and freaking kicked it's butt. I look up to JJ in so many ways. I'm sure he's a great coworker (didn't work with him a ton) but I know for a fact that he's an even better friend, mentor, person, and daddio.

                My favorite memory is when his dog had diarrhea on the beautiful, white living room carpet. </p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ. Mr. Scott. The Legend. - It's hard to imagine this place without you! Thank you for inspiring me, challenging me, and always making me laugh. You have taught me so much in our time working together, and I know you will do the same for every colleague you encounter. And I'll miss getting to bond over all the joyous (and not so joyous) moments parenthood brings. It's been fun going through that together! Praying for you and the fam as you embark on this new adventure!

                You're awesome. Don't ever change. Keep it weird down there, like only you can. </p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ, you are a brilliant writer and strategist. You ask excellent questions to understand, to challenge, and to improve. You are an absolute goofball who is very talented at delivering absolutely ridiculous statements with a straight face. I will continue to read up on icamehereforthefood.com, and I can't wait till that expands to every single eatery in Austin.
                <br><br>
                HAGS, JJ. Miss you already. </p>

            <p class="text-center">It's rare to come across a dude like you. Selfish in the pursuit for better yet deeply selfless, confident & talented yet genuinely humble, intelligent and cerebral yet unabashedly hilarious. Spending time as one of your colleagues will always be one of the biggest rewards of my career. I am grateful for you and grateful to know you. Stay you, friend!</p>

            <p class="text-center">Boy did I luck out when I was paired with JJ during my internship with Primitive! I am so grateful for the opportunity to learn from someone so incredibly talented and just plain cool. I'll miss JJ's ability to turn any ordinary piece of work into something you're proud of and how he makes those around him feel important. And who could forget his 10/10 out of the box questions? He truly cares about getting to know people and it's part of what makes working with him so special. Good luck JJ, you're going to do big things in Austin! </p>

            <p class="text-center">Every time I got to work alongside JJ, I was reminded of how truly creative, passionate, and strategic he is. I will miss hopping on a call with him to just brainstorm ideas and learn from him. He sees things in ways others just don't and I will miss spending that time with him. He is going to be sorely missed!</p>

            <p class="text-center">Favorite memory- I feel like this needs a backstory. I had just quit my job and was a broke college kid that was also planning a wedding so all my money was being dumped into that. Well, I broke my laptop screen and had to pay about $900 to fix it. Oh well, life goes on. Flash forward one month I was at interning at Primitive. I took a lunch break to go pay for my wedding invitations and was kind of freaking out at the cost of those. Speeding back to the office, got stopped and got a ticket. Life was going great. :-) Got back to the office and opened my laptop. Screen was shattered. I was in shock and then instantly started crying, LOL. Turns out JJ was playing a prank on me. Another girl in the office had the exact laptop case and her screen was the one messed up. I’ll never forget the scared look on his face when I started crying. He had no idea I had just paid to fix it the month before or any of the other stuff. It was hilarious and we all had a good laugh afterwards.
                <br><br>
                We will miss you so much JJ! You were such a great teammate and Primitive won’t be the same without you!</p>

            <p class="text-center">I don't work in the office and only fill a small role at Primitive, but at the all team meeting in 2019, JJ walked up and specifically introduced himself to me. It was very kind. He probably treats everyone like that! </p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ the legend - In the 3 years i've known JJ we've been able to get some amazing work done together, but more importantly we've been able to hang out a few times as friends. I think some of the best times have been when we all went to the Addy's (wild time haha), and drinking Whiskey sours at that Jazz bar in LBK!
                <br><br>

                I'm going to miss having JJ to share sick and twisted jokes with and also talking about who we think will win the next UFC fights that are coming up... but not so much, because Kiki and I will 100% be coming to Austin to see you guys!
                <br><br>

                You're the man JJ!️</p>
