            <p class="text-center">We are definitely going to miss you JJ! You have been an awesome co-worker and a great friend, and there will be a JJ-sized hole in my life once you leave. I wish you the best man, and hope that our paths cross again! Good luck!</p>

            <p class="text-center">So sad to see you go, man - but super excited for you as well. I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed getting to work with you over the past 3 years. I know y'all are going to love ATX, and I'll definitely hit you up when I'm in town. Also, we still need to schedule that movie night ASAP before you leave! Cheers brotha!</p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ has always been incredibly welcoming and cool since the very jump. He was one of the first people I met the first time I walked into Primitive and ever since then, he's been nothing shy of a class-act. Funny, wise, "with it" when it comes to food, always down to talk music, and always eager to show a genuine interest in the stuff that meant something to you. He might be leaving Primitive, but he's moving to my neck of the woods, which means I still get to grab a beer with him or try new food when he's down. Thanks JJ. Much love.</p>

            <p class="text-center">I wish I would have gotten to work with and learn from JJ more than I did. He's incredibly talented, thoughtful, and hilarious. The opportunities I did have to interact with him were always insightful and more importantly joyful. It's evident how deeply he cares for his craft and his coworkers. He'll be terribly missed :broken_heart: </p>

            <p class="text-center">JJ! A reliable teammate, someone who pushes me to think deeper about strategy, and always makes me feel like you actually care about what's going on in my life. You will be greatly missed around here. And to finally answer your question....Yes, my dad is indeed a Dojo ðŸ˜œ</p>

            <p class="text-center">I appreciate that JJ is so incredibly thoughtful and aware of othersâ€™ needs. He loves and gives of himself sacrificially. Favorite memory: table one good times and him playing my favorite music on my birthday. Also, his Costco video for the October 2020 virtual all team.</p>

            <p class="text-center">I will miss you Papa John. I'm glad you are chasing what you want to do though and hope you have a great time doing it. One of my favorite memories of JJ is when he posted a picture of his baby and it looked exactly like JJ. I think it's cool when people become dads.</p>

        <div class="row pt-8 w-1/2 mx-auto">
            <p class="text-center">The thing that I appreciate about JJ and will miss the most is his sincerity. JJ is someone that says what he means and does what he says. He's a loyal/selfless friend and those things go beyond the immense amount of skill set he has.

                My favorite memories involve a fire and glass of whiskey - Or, running into him and his family at the park. </p>
